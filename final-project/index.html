                        Computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum was there at the

                    <h5>
                        In 1966, an MIT professor named Joseph Weizenbaum
                        created the first chatbot. He cast it in the role of a
                        psychotherapist. A user would type a message on an
                        electric typewriter connected to a mainframe. After a
                        moment, the “psychotherapist” would reply.
                    </h5>
                    <h4>User: Men are all alike.</h4>
                    <h4>Chatbot: IN WHAT WAY</h4>
                    <h4>
                        User: They’re always bugging us about something or
                        other.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>Chatbot: CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE</h4>
                    <h4>User: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.</h4>
                    <h4>Chatbot: YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE</h4>
                    <h4>User: He says I’m depressed much of the time.</h4>
                    <h4>Chatbot: I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED</h4>
                    <h5>
                        Weizenbaum published this sample exchange in a journal
                        article that explained how the chatbot worked. The
                        software was relatively simple. It looked at the user
                        input and applied a set of rules to generate a plausible
                        response. He called the program Eliza, after Eliza
                        Doolittle in Pygmalion. The cockney flower girl in
                        George Bernard Shaw’s play uses language to produce an
                        illusion: she elevates her elocution to the point where
                        she can pass for a duchess. Similarly, Eliza would speak
                        in such a way as to produce the illusion that it
                        understood the person sitting at the typewriter.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        “Some subjects have been very hard to convince that
                        Eliza (with its present script) is not human,”
                        Weizenbaum wrote. In a follow-up article that appeared
                        the next year, he was more specific: one day, he said,
                        his secretary requested some time with Eliza. After a
                        few moments, she asked Weizenbaum to leave the room. “I
                        believe this anecdote testifies to the success with
                        which the program maintains the illusion of
                        understanding,” he noted.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Eliza isn’t exactly obscure. It caused a stir at the
                        time – the Boston Globe sent a reporter to go and sit at
                        the typewriter and ran an excerpt of the conversation –
                        and remains one of the best known developments in the
                        history of computing. More recently, the release of
                        ChatGPT has renewed interest in it. In the last year,
                        Eliza has been invoked in the Guardian, the New York
                        Times, the Atlantic and elsewhere. The reason that
                        people are still thinking about a piece of software that
                        is nearly 60 years old has nothing to do with its
                        technical aspects, which weren’t terribly sophisticated
                        even by the standards of its time. Rather, Eliza
                        illuminated a mechanism of the human mind that strongly
                        affects how we relate to computers.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Early in his career, Sigmund Freud noticed that his
                        patients kept falling in love with him. It wasn’t
                        because he was exceptionally charming or good-looking,
                        he concluded. Instead, something more interesting was
                        going on: transference. Briefly, transference refers to
                        our tendency to project feelings about someone from our
                        past on to someone in our present. While it is amplified
                        by being in psychoanalysis, it is a feature of all
                        relationships. When we interact with other people, we
                        always bring a group of ghosts to the encounter. The
                        residue of our earlier life, and above all our
                        childhood, is the screen through which we see one
                        another.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        This concept helps make sense of people’s reactions to
                        Eliza. Weizenbaum had stumbled across the computerised
                        version of transference, with people attributing
                        understanding, empathy and other human characteristics
                        to software. While he never used the term himself, he
                        had a long history with psychoanalysis that clearly
                        informed how he interpreted what would come to be called
                        the “Eliza effect”.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        As computers have become more capable, the Eliza effect
                        has only grown stronger. Take the way many people relate
                        to ChatGPT. Inside the chatbot is a “large language
                        model”, a mathematical system that is trained to predict
                        the next string of characters, words, or sentences in a
                        sequence. What distinguishes ChatGPT is not only the
                        complexity of the large language model that underlies
                        it, but its eerily conversational voice. As Colin
                        Fraser, a data scientist at Meta, has put it, the
                        application is “designed to trick you, to make you think
                        you’re talking to someone who’s not actually there”.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        But the Eliza effect is far from the only reason to
                        return to Weizenbaum. His experience with the software
                        was the beginning of a remarkable journey. As an MIT
                        professor with a prestigious career, he was, in his
                        words, a “high priest, if not a bishop, in the cathedral
                        to modern science”. But by the 1970s, Joseph Weizenbaum
                        had become a heretic, publishing articles and books that
                        condemned the worldview of his colleagues and warned of
                        the dangers posed by their work. Artificial
                        intelligence, he came to believe, was an “index of the
                        insanity of our world.”
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Today, the view that artificial intelligence poses some
                        kind of threat is no longer a minority position among
                        those working on it. There are different opinions on
                        which risks we should be most worried about, but many
                        prominent researchers, from Timnit Gebru to Geoffrey
                        Hinton – both ex-Google computer scientists – share the
                        basic view that the technology can be toxic.
                        Weizenbaum’s pessimism made him a lonely figure among
                        computer scientists during the last three decades of his
                        life; he would be less lonely in 2023.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        There is so much in Weizenbaum’s thinking that is
                        urgently relevant now. Perhaps his most fundamental
                        heresy was the belief that the computer revolution,
                        which Weizenbaum not only lived through but centrally
                        participated in, was actually a counter-revolution. It
                        strengthened repressive power structures instead of
                        upending them. It constricted rather than enlarged our
                        humanity, prompting people to think of themselves as
                        little more than machines. By ceding so many decisions
                        to computers, he thought, we had created a world that
                        was more unequal and less rational, in which the
                        richness of human reason had been flattened into the
                        senseless routines of code.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Weizenbaum liked to say that every person is the product
                        of a particular history. His ideas bear the imprint of
                        his own particular history, which was shaped above all
                        by the atrocities of the 20th century and the demands of
                        his personal demons. Computers came naturally to him.
                        The hard part, he said, was life.

                        What it means to be human – and how a human is different
                        from a computer – was something Weizenbaum spent a lot
                        of time thinking about. So it’s fitting that his own
                        humanity was up for debate from the start. His mother
                        had a difficult labour, and felt some disappointment at
                        the result. “When she was finally shown me, she thought
                        I was a bloody mess and hardly looked human,” Weizenbaum
                        later recalled. “She couldn’t believe this was supposed
                        to be her child.”

                    <h5>
                        He was born in 1923, the youngest son of an assimilated,
                        upper-middle class Jewish family in Berlin. His father,
                        Jechiel, who had emigrated to Germany from Galicia,
                        which spanned what is now south-eastern Poland and
                        western Ukraine, at the age of 12, was an accomplished
                        furrier who had acquired a comfortable foothold in
                        society, a nice apartment, and a much younger Viennese
                        wife (Weizenbaum’s mother). From the start, Jechiel
                        treated his son with a contempt that would haunt
                        Weizenbaum for the rest of his life. “My father was
                        absolutely convinced that I was a worthless moron, a
                        complete fool, that I would never become anything,”
                        Weizenbaum later told the documentary film-makers Peter
                        Haas and Silvia Holzinger.

                    <h5>
                        By the time he was old enough to make memories, the
                        Nazis were everywhere. His family lived near a bar
                        frequented by Hitler’s paramilitaries, the SA, and
                        sometimes he would see people getting dragged inside to
                        be beaten up in the backroom. Once, while he was out
                        with his nanny, columns of armed communists and Nazis
                        lined up and started shooting at each other. The nanny
                        pushed him under a parked car until the bullets stopped
                        flying.

                    <h5>
                        Shortly after Hitler became chancellor in 1933, the
                        government passed a law that severely restricted the
                        number of Jews in public schools. Weizenbaum had to
                        transfer to a Jewish boys’ school. It was here that he
                        first came into contact with the Ostjuden: Jews from
                        eastern Europe, poor, dressed in rags, speaking Yiddish.
                        To Weizenbaum, they may as well have come from Mars.
                        Nevertheless, the time he spent with them gave him what
                        he later described as “a new feeling of camaraderie”, as
                        well as a “sensitivity for oppression”. He became deeply
                        attached to one of his classmates in particular. “If
                        fate had been different, I would have developed a
                        homosexual love for this boy,” he later said. The boy
                        “led me into his world”, the world of the Jewish ghetto
                        around Berlin’s Grenadierstrasse. “They had nothing,
                        owned nothing, but somehow supported each other,” he
                        recalled.

                    <h5>
                        One day, he brought the boy back to his family’s
                        apartment. His father, himself once a poor Jewish boy
                        from eastern Europe, was disgusted and furious. Jechiel
                        was very proud, Weizenbaum remembered – and he had
                        reason to be, given the literal and figurative distances
                        he had travelled from the shtetl. Now his son was
                        bringing the shtetl back into his home.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Alienated from his parents, richer than his classmates,
                        and a Jew in Nazi Germany: Weizenbaum felt comfortable
                        nowhere. His instinct, he said, was always to “bite the
                        hand that fed me”, to provoke the paternal figure, to be
                        a pain in the backside. And this instinct presumably
                        proceeded from the lesson he learned from his father’s
                        hostility toward him and bigotry toward the boy he
                        loved: that danger could lie within one’s home, people,
                        tribe.

                    <h7>Leaving Germany</h7>
                    <h5>
                        In 1936, the family left Germany suddenly, possibly
                        because Jechiel had slept with the girlfriend of an SA
                        member. Weizenbaum’s aunt owned a bakery in Detroit, so
                        that’s where they went. At 13, he found himself 4,000
                        miles from everything he knew. “I was very, very
                        lonely,” he recalled. School became a refuge from
                        reality – specifically algebra, which didn’t require
                        English, which he didn’t speak at first. “Of all the
                        things that one could study,” he later said,
                        “mathematics seemed by far the easiest. Mathematics is a
                        game. It is entirely abstract.”
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        In his school’s metalworking class, he learned to
                        operate a lathe. The experience brought him out of his
                        brain and into his body. About 70 years later, he looked
                        back on the realisation prompted by this new skill: that
                        intelligence “isn’t just in the head but also in the
                        arm, in the wrist, in the hand”. Thus, at a young age,
                        two concepts were in place that would later steer his
                        career as a practitioner and critic of AI: on the one
                        hand, an appreciation for the pleasures of abstraction;
                        on the other, a suspicion of those pleasures as
                        escapist, and a related understanding that human
                        intelligence exists in the whole person and not in any
                        one part.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        In 1941, Weizenbaum enrolled at the local public
                        university. Wayne University was a working-class place:
                        cheap to attend, filled with students holding down
                        full-time jobs. The seeds of social consciousness that
                        had been planted in Berlin started to grow: Weizenbaum
                        saw parallels between the oppression of Black people in
                        Detroit and that of the Jews under Hitler. This was also
                        a time of incandescent class struggle in the city – the
                        United Auto Workers union won its first contract with
                        Ford the same year that Weizenbaum entered college.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Weizenbaum’s growing leftwing political commitments
                        complicated his love of mathematics. “I wanted to do
                        something for the world or society,” he remembered. “To
                        study plain mathematics, as if the world were doing
                        fine, or even didn’t exist at all – that’s not what I
                        wanted.” He soon had his chance. In 1941, the US entered
                        the second world war; the following year, Weizenbaum was
                        drafted. He spent the next five years working as a
                        meteorologist for the Army Air corps, stationed on
                        different bases across the US. The military was a
                        “salvation”, he later said. What fun, to get free of his
                        family and fight Hitler at the same time.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        While home on furlough, he began a romance with Selma
                        Goode, a Jewish civil rights activist and early member
                        of the Democratic Socialists of America. Before long
                        they were married, with a baby boy, and after the war
                        Weizenbaum moved back to Detroit. There, he resumed his
                        studies at Wayne, now financed by the federal government
                        through the GI Bill.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Then, in the late 1940s, the couple got divorced, with
                        Goode taking custody of their son. “That was incredibly
                        tragic for me,” Weizenbaum later said. “It took me a
                        long time to get over it.” His mental state was forever
                        unsteady: his daughter Pm – pronounced “Pim” and named
                        after the New York leftwing daily newspaper PM – told me
                        that he had been hospitalised for anorexia during his
                        time at university. Everything he did, he felt he did
                        badly. In the army he was promoted to sergeant and
                        honourably discharged; nonetheless, he left convinced
                        that he had somehow hindered the war effort. He later
                        attributed his self-doubt to his father constantly
                        telling him he was worthless. “If something like that is
                        repeated to you as a child, you end up believing it
                        yourself,” he reflected.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        In the wake of the personal crisis produced by Selma’s
                        departure came two consequential first encounters. He
                        went into psychoanalysis and he went into computing.

                    <h5>
                        In those days, a computer, like a psyche, was an
                        interior. “You didn’t go to the computer,” Weizenbaum
                        said in a 2010 documentary. “Instead, you went inside of
                        it.” The war had provided the impetus for building
                        gigantic machines that could mechanise the hard work of
                        mathematical calculation. Computers helped crack Nazi
                        encryption and find the best angles for aiming
                        artillery. The postwar consolidation of the
                        military-industrial complex, in the early days of the
                        cold war, drew large sums of US government money into
                        developing the technology. By the late 1940s, the
                        fundamentals of the modern computer were in place.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        But it still wasn’t easy to get one. So one of
                        Weizenbaum’s professors resolved to build his own. He
                        assembled a small team of students and invited
                        Weizenbaum to join. Constructing the computer,
                        Weizenbaum grew happy and purposeful. “I was full of
                        life and enthusiastic about my work,” he remembered.
                        Here were the forces of abstraction that he first
                        encountered in middle-school algebra. Like algebra, a
                        computer modelled, and thereby simplified, reality – yet
                        it could do so with such fidelity that one could easily
                        forget that it was only a representation. Software also
                        imparted a sense of mastery. “The programmer has a kind
                        of power over a stage incomparably larger than that of a
                        theatre director,” he later said in the 2007 documentary
                        Rebel at Work. “Bigger than that of Shakespeare.”
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        About this time, Weizenbaum met a schoolteacher named
                        Ruth Manes. In 1952, they married and moved into a small
                        apartment near the university. She “couldn’t have been
                        further from him culturally”, their daughter Miriam told
                        me. She wasn’t a Jewish socialist like his first wife –
                        her family was from the deep south. Their marriage
                        represented “a reach for normalcy and a settled life” on
                        his part, Miriam said. His political passions cooled.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        By the early 1960s, Weizenbaum was working as a
                        programmer for General Electric in Silicon Valley. He
                        and Ruth were raising three daughters and would soon
                        have a fourth. At GE, he built a computer for the Navy
                        that launched missiles and a computer for Bank of
                        America that processed cheques.
